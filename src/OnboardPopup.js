import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import OnboardingPopup from './OnboardingPopup';

function App() {
    const [showPopup, setShowPopup] = useState(false);

    useEffect(() => {
        const timer = setTimeout(() => {
            setShowPopup(true);
        }, 5000); // Change this to control the delay

        return () => clearTimeout(timer);
    }, []);

    return (
        <div className="App">
            {/* Your other components */}

export default App;

//* In this example, OnboardingPopup is the component for your onboarding pop-up. The useEffect hook sets a timer that changes the showPopup state to true after a certain delay (5000 milliseconds or 5 seconds in this case). When showPopup is true, the OnboardingPopup component is rendered.

Remember to replace './OnboardingPopup' with the actual path to your OnboardingPopup component file.

This is a simple implementation and might need adjustments based on your project requirements. For example, you might want to show the pop-up only once for each user. In that case, you can use cookies or local storage to keep track of whether the pop-up has been shown before.
